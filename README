Tested only on Linux systems, should work on MAX OS X


1. make a soft link or copy of the library file 
   {liblpsolve55 libcplexXXXX}.so(.dylib on max os x) 
   to lib directory. Overwrite the symbolic link if 
   you need to.

2. $ ruby extconf.rb
   # Generate the Makefile
   
3. $ make

4. $ ./test_cplex.rb
   $ ./test_lpsolve.rb

5. If you can get output, 
   Congrats, I think it works on your platform
